Astronomer at the National Astronomical Observatories, CAS
------
I am an associate professor of Astronomy at [National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.nao.cas.cn).
    My research focuses on observational astronomy, in particular the area of the physical properties of galaxies, as well as optical sky surveys. We use observations across the electromagnetic spectrum - from radio to infrared - to research the morphology (especially galactic bars), star formation, gas of galaxies. I also work on the pipeline development of data reduction for large optical sky surveys, focusing on the flux calibration.


Some of my research highlights include:
------
<ul>
  <li>Galactic bars</li> 
  <li>Galaxy morphology</li>    
  <li>Star formation in galaxies</li>
  <li>Flux calibration for sky surveys </li>
  <li>Multi-wavelength photometric sky surveys</li>
</ul>
